1. What question are you trying to answer?

    I am someone who hosts dinner for my friends every sunday. Along with dinner we tend to watch movies, and to be frank I am running out of movies to watch with them. Google movie reccomendations are absolutely trash and I need something else. I hope to find some of the best and worst movies from a database of nearly 1 million titles with the ability to filter by year, genre, actor, and contry of origin. Hopefully this simplified system without the bells and whistles of a reccomendation algorithm behind it will simplify the process of finding new and exciting things I might have missed in the past.

2. Why is this question worth answering? This can be either because it has some personal value to you or because it is a question that others are asking. If it is a question others are asking, then provide an example.

    I spoke about it breifly in what the question is trying to answer but I mostly would like to do this in order to quickly find new good and bad movies to watch with my friends. For example, I could finish cooking and boot up netflix, scroll for 15 minutes finding only the same titles over and over again, close netflix, open up Max and suffer the same fate, until I settle on a movie 30 minutes later. Or I can quickly pick a mood I want, decide on a genre and time frame for release and have a sorted list by the most popular movies to meet my criteria. I can also find old movies that are completely burried by modern titles on these streaming services. I wouldnt know where to start to find a movie from the 60s without naming the classics that most already know for example. And I dont really trust peoples curated lists.

3. What is your hypothesis? Why leads you towards that hypothesis?

    My hypothesis is that there will be plenty of movies that I have missed (especially foreign films), and plenty that I have forgotten that will make this a worthwhile experience. I also imagine that this will be easier and harder than I imagine, easier because the DB is very well organised and documented(no refactoring necessary thank goodness), as well as the queries necessary on them being very similar to the ones I ran back in databases. Harder because it is wider than anything I have worked with. My hope is that I get the main functionality done fairly quickly and I can start playing around with extra features like displaying blurbs, linking to reviews etc. *I also expect this to be a fairly popular choice of database among the class and hope that with my expedited submission this will be accepted (not sure if duplicates are allowed yet)*

4. What is the primary dataset(s) you will use to answer the question? The dataset(s) must be at least 15GB in their original form when downloaded. Provide links. You may not choose r/place (any year) as your analysis set.
